# Diff Tool Task

This is a skeleton for a group task to implement
**a utility program for comparing files**.

<br>

## Contents
  - [`main.c`](src/main.c) with an example `main()` function
    _(this kind of structure will make your life much easier later)_;
  - [`include/`](include/) with some headers suggesting modules
    that you may want to implement in `src/`;
  - [`tests/`](tests/) with sample input files & expected output,
    divided into solution stages _(more on this later)_;
  - `run_tests.py` so you don't spend more time
    in the terminal than in your editor _(usage below)_.
  - [`Makefile`](bld/Makefile) to build the project _(see below)_.

### Changing the skeleton
You are free to make any _informed_ changes to any of the provided files
or the directory structure; meaning you should understand the reasons
for the initial contents first, and only then adjust them to your needs.

### Usage of `run_tests.py`

### Building with make
